My Pytorch implementation of a Neural Turing Machine with bidirectional LSTM controller

## Credit
The sources I used for general guidance and some parts of the code:

- https://github.com/nerdimite/ntm
- https://github.com/loudinthecloud/pytorch-ntm/tree/master
- https://www.niklasschmidinger.com/posts/2019-12-25-neural-turing-machines/

The implementation of the stacked bidirectional controller and all related changes are by me, as well as other changes concerning architecture, code style and refactoring.

The video below provides a very clear and concise explanation of the inner workings of NTM:
